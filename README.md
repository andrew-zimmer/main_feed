# Main Feed
Main Feed is a work in progress, project and employee management application for construction companies. The end goal is to have a application that allows super_admins to manage all aspects of an construction projects (materials, creating a schedule for employees, blue prints, projected start and end dates, on-site contacts, ect.) and giving field personnel access that information. Main Feed will also keep track of employee information ( contact info, work title, associated workers, employee certifications, employee security badges). With Main Feed a company will have a single place where field and office personnel can share and view pertinent information on projects and employees.
